# Optimized uint64-to-double

## Source Instruction
Here is the relevant line from the original C code:

```c
double average(const int *arr, size_t n) {
    if (n == 0) return 0.0;
    return (double)sum_array(arr, n) / (double)n;// the line we will optimize
}
```

## GCC/Clang Compilation Logic
For very large arrays, compilers generate code to safely convert the `long` sum to a `double`:

```asm
call sum_array ; sum_array returns in rax (long)
pxor xmm0, xmm0 ; zero xmm0
test rsi, rsi ; check if n == 0
cvtsi2sdq xmm0, rax ; convert long sum to double
js .L24 ; jump if negative (rare case for signed)
pxor xmm1, xmm1 ; zero xmm1
cvtsi2sdq xmm1, rsi ; convert size_t n to double
divsd xmm0, xmm1 ; compute average
.L24:
mov rax, rsi ; branch for extreme cases
shr rax ; divide by 2
and esi, 1 ; extract lowest bit
or rax, rsi ; adjust for rounding odd numbers
cvtsi2sdq xmm1, rax ; convert to double
addsd xmm1, xmm1 ; multiply by 2
jmp .L25 ; jump back to division
```

- The `js .L24` branch handles extreme cases.
- For very large `n` (≥ 2^63), the compiler may use a shift/OR trick to avoid signed conversion overflow.

---

## Logic Behind the Compiler
- Converts `sum` (signed) to double using `cvtsi2sdq`. 
- Converts `n` (unsigned) to double safely using:
  ```c
  2 * (double)((n >> 1) | (n & 1))
  ```
- Ensures both even and odd `n` are handled correctly.
- For large `n`, rounding differences are irrelevant due to floating-point precision.

## Optimized Formula
Instead of the complex compiler sequence, we can use a simpler single-line formula:

```c
double result = (double)(sum_array(arr, n) >> 1) * 2 / (double)n;
```

### Assembly Equivalent of Optimized Formula
```asm
call    sum_array      ; rax = sum
shr     rax, 1         ; divide sum by 2
cvtsi2sd xmm0, rax     ; convert to double
addsd   xmm0, xmm0     ; multiply by 2
cvtsi2sd xmm1, rsi     ; convert n to double
divsd   xmm0, xmm1     ; compute average
```
- Fewer instructions (no branch, no OR) compared to compiler output.
- Produces identical result for practical floating-point precision ranges.

---

## Why Both Produce the Same Result
- **Even numbers:** `(n >> 1) * 2 == n` exactly.
- **Odd numbers:** For very large values (`n >= 2^63`), doubles cannot represent consecutive integers, so rounding up or down has no effect.
- The shift-and-double trick replicates the logic of the compiler's shift/OR rounding safely, but with fewer instructions.
- Floating-point precision ensures that `(double)(n >> 1) * 2 / (double)n` is numerically identical to the compiler's full sequence for all practical array sizes.

## Summary
| Feature | GCC/Clang | Optimized Formula |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| Instructions | 6+ | 4 (shift, convert, multiply, divide) |
| Handles extreme n safely | ✅ | ✅ (for doubles) |
| Branches | yes (`js`) | no |
| Rounding of odd numbers | up | up (effectively the same due to precision) |

**Conclusion:** The optimized formula reduces instruction count and avoids unnecessary branches while producing the same double-precision result as the compiler-generated code, making it ideal for high-performance `average()` computations.
